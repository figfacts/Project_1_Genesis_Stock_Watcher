# Stock-Watcher ==> Team Genesis - Project 01

## Description

The app should operate within the following requirements:
1. The user can search a stock ticker and be shown:
    * Detailed stock information for the entered stock ticker.
    * A favorites panel showing info for the favorite stocks.
    * News for the stock ticker selected
2. The block that displays the detailed stock information should show:
    * Stock symbol
    * Exchange where it is traded
    * Opening price 
    * High stock price for current/last day traded 
    * Low stock price for current/last day traded
    * Last closing price
    * Percentage change (should be color coded to denote positive/negatve)
    * Volume traded for current/last day traded
    * A button to save to the favorites
3. The block that displays stock favorites should show:
    * Stock symbol
    * Opening price
    * Current price
    * Percentage change (should be color coded to denote postive/negative)
    * Buttons to allow:
        * Show stock info
        * Show news
        * Delete from favorites
4.  The searched stock ticker entered should be:
    * Capitalized appropriately
    * Prompted for corrections for entries that aren't valid ticker symbols
